## Rights & Exclusivity

- Enrolling in **KDP Select** makes your eBook **exclusive to Amazon** (cannot sell on other platforms simultaneously)
- If using your own ISBN: title, author name, and binding type must match exactly

## Common Rejection Reasons (Avoid These)
1. Description contains URLs, emails, or phone numbers
2. Description contains emojis
3. Title includes promotional language ("bestselling")
4. Keywords include other authors' names (zero-tolerance policy)
5. Cover closely resembles another book's layout, color scheme, or fonts
6. Book description is too short (< 100 words) — hurts discoverability
7. Categories don't match book content
